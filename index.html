      <h1>Sorting Algo...</h1>
      <p>
        Just like the way bubbles rise from the bottom of a glass, bubble sort is a simple algorithm that sorts a list, allowing either lower or higher values to bubble up to the top.<br>The algorithm traverses a list and compares adjacent values, swapping them if they are not in the correct order.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a worst-case complexity of O(n^2), bubble sort is very slow compared to other sorting algorithms like quicksort. The upside is that it is one of the easiest sorting algorithms to understand and code from scratch.
